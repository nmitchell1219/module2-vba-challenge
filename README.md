# VBA Challenge

In this VBA challenge, I created a script to automate the analysis of stock market data, calculating changes in stock prices and total volumes for each ticker over multiple years. It identifies top performers and applies conditional formatting for easy visual analysis. My script runs on multiple worksheets, showcasing my ability to streamline complex data analysis with VBA.
